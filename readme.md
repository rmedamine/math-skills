# Math Skills

## Overview

Welcome to the **Math Skills** project! This project involves developing a program to calculate and display statistical measures from a dataset. The primary goal is to compute the following statistics from a file of numerical data:

- Average
- Median
- Variance
- Standard Deviation

## Project Structure

- **Repo URL**: [Math Skills Repository](https://learn.zone01oujda.ma/git/rmohamme/math-skills)

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to:

1. **Read data from a file**: Your program should be able to read a file where each line contains a numerical value.
2. **Compute statistics**: Calculate the average, median, variance, and standard deviation of the values in the file.
3. **Print results**: Display the computed statistics in a formatted output.
